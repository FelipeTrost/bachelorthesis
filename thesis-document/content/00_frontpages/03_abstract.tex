This thesis explores the integration of multi-tenancy functionality into cloud
applications, on the example of the PROCEED Management System (MS).
Currently, the PROCEED MS lacks comprehensive multi-tenancy support, restricting collaborative workflows primarily to individual users.
To address this limitation, isolated environments were introduced, enabling multiple users
or organizations to collaboratively manage their assets within distinct, secure
workspaces.

%Roles where adapted and Folder structure created to mirror organizational structures and enhance asset management.
A hierarchical folder structure was designed to mirror organizational structures and enhance asset management.
The existing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system within PROCEED was also extended to incorporate environment-specific and folder-specific permissions.

Key aspects of the implementation included restructuring asset and user management,
% integrating OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for robust user authentication,
and establishing clear, efficient database schemas for environments and their related assets.
The developed solution supports personal and organizational environments, allowing users to seamlessly transition between independent projects and collaborative tasks.

The evaluation confirms the successful fulfillment of the outlined functional and
non-functional requirements.
