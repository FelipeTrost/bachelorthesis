  abstract = {The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party
              application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on
              behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction
              between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the
              third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. This
              specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol
