  abstract = {Multi-tenancy is a relatively new software architecture principle
              in the realm of the Software as a Service (SaaS) business model. It
              allows to make full use of the economy of scale, as multiple
              customers - "tenants" - share the same application and database
              instance. All the while, the tenants enjoy a highly configurable
              application, making it appear that the application is deployed on a
              dedicated server. The major benefits of multi-tenancy are increased
              utilization of hardware resources and improved ease of maintenance,
              in particular on the deployment side. These benefits should result
              in lower overall application costs, making the technology
              attractive for service providers targeting small and medium
              enterprises (SME). However, as this paper advocates, a wrong
              architectural choice might entail that multi-tenancy becomes a
              maintenance nightmare.},
